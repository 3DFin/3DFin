Welcome to 3DFin: 3D Forest inventory's official repository!

3DFin is a free software for automatic computation of tree parameters in terrestrial point clouds. It offers the users a quick, ease-of-use interface to load their forest plots and generate tree metrics with just a few clicks.

3DFin is available as a standalone program, which can be downloaded in _Download_, as a _CloudCompare plugin_ and, soon, as a _QGIS plugin_.
