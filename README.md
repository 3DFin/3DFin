Welcome to 3DFin: 3D Forest inventory's official repository!

3DFin is a free software for automatic computation of tree parameters in terrestrial point clouds. It offers the users a quick, ease-of-use interface to load their forest plots and generate tree metrics with just a few clicks.

3DFin is available as a standalone program, which can be downloaded in _Download_ and as a _CloudCompare plugin_.

Be sure to check the [Documentation](https://github.com/3DFIN/3DFIN/blob/main/src/three_d_fin/assets/documentation.pdf), which features detailed explanations on how the program works and an User manual.
