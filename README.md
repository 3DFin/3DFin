Welcome to 3DFin: 3D Forest inventory's official repository!

3DFin is a free software for automatic computation of tree parameters in terrestrial point clouds. It offers the users a quick, ease-of-use interface to load their forest plots and generate tree metrics with just a few clicks.

3DFin is available as a standalone program, which can be downloaded in _Download_, as a _CloudCompare plugin_ and, soon, as a _QGIS plugin_.


# Download 

To download the latest version of 3DFin, simply click on the link below:

# CloudCompare plugin

3DFin is also available as a plugin in CloudCompare. CloudCompare is the largest, most used, free software for 3D point cloud visualization and manipulation. 


# QGIS plugin

Good news! Soon, 3DFin will also be available as a plugin in QGIS, the most used free software for GIS data.
