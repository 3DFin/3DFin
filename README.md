Welcome to 3DFin: 3D Forest inventory's official repository!

3DFin is a free software for automatic computation of tree parameters in terrestrial point clouds. It offers the users a quick, ease-of-use interface to load their forest plots and generate tree metrics with just a few clicks.

Be sure to check the [Documentation](https://github.com/3DFin/3DFin/blob/main/src/three_d_fin/documentation/documentation.pdf), which features detailed explanations on how the program works and an User manual.


# Download 

3DFin is available in Windows as a standalone program, which can be downloaded from here: [Download](https://github.com/3DFin/3DFin/releases/download/3DFin.exe).

Older versions of 3DFin may also be downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/3DFin/3DFin/releases/). From there, simply navigate to the desired version and click on __3DFin.exe__.


3DFin and its dependencies may be installed and launched on any OS from the command line after cloning the repository. 

```console
git clone https://github.com/3DFin/3DFin.git
cd 3DFin
pip install .
python -m three_d_fin
```

pip will also install a script entry point in your Python installation's bin|script directory, so alternatively you can launch 3DFin from the command line with:  

```console
3DFin[.exe]
```

macOS user may need to install and use an openMP capable compiler, such as GCC from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) in order to install the dependencies. 


# Usage

By default running 3Dfin will open a GUI window. The [documentation](https://github.com/3DFin/3DFin/blob/main/src/three_d_fin/documentation/documentation.pdf) contains a detailed explanation of the GUI and its functionalities.

For batch processing you can use the CLI capabilities of 3DFin and running the following command:
```console
3DFin[.exe] cli --help
```
will give you an overview of the available parameters. 

3DFin is also available as a plugin for [CloudCompare](https://www.danielgm.net/cc/) thanks to [CloudCompare-PythonPlugin](https://github.com/tmontaigu/CloudCompare-PythonPlugin). Installation is still somewhat cumbersome as it requires latest development versions of both CloudCompare and CloudCompare-PythonPlugin, but 3DFin will hopefully be available in CloudCompare 2.13 when it is released.


# Further releases

Good news! Soon, 3DFin will also be available as a plugin in [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/), the most used free software for GIS data.

# Citing 3DFin

As of now, the best way to cite 3DFin is by referring to the original paper describing the algorithm behind:

Cabo, C., Ordóñez, C., López-Sánchez, C. A., & Armesto, J. (2018). Automatic dendrometry: Tree detection, tree height and diameter estimation using terrestrial laser scanning. International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation, 69, 164–174. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jag.2018.01.011

Or directly citing the repository itself:

We are currently working on a scientific article about 3DFin, which may be published in 2023.
